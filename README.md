# Scrumerica

Scrumerica is an open coordination experiment.

It exists to make it easier for people to work on small, useful things together without ideology, gatekeeping, or invisible power. It is not a platform, a company, or a finished vision.

The only thing Scrumerica enforces is **transparency**.

If you are working on something, others should be able to see:
- what you are working on
- why you think it matters
- what you expect to produce
- how and when it can be tested or used
- where you are stuck, if you are stuck

Scrumerica is intentionally lightweight. There is no central roadmap, no approval process, and no requirement to agree on “the right approach” before starting work.

People are encouraged to:
- fork ideas
- disagree in public
- build in parallel
- abandon work honestly
- document mistakes so others don’t repeat them

This repository does not contain product code.

It contains **records of work** — a registry of projects, intentions, outcomes, and lessons learned — so that coordination can happen without hierarchy.

If you want to build something, start building it.
If you want others to know, register it here.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` to understand how.
