# Contributing to Scrumerica

This repository is a coordination surface, not a codebase.

You do not need permission to start work.
You do need to make your work visible.

Transparency is the only contract.

---

## What Counts as a Contribution

A contribution to Scrumerica is **not** a pull request with code.

A contribution is a **registered project** that makes its work legible to others.

This repo exists to answer one question:

> “Who is working on what, and how can I understand or help?”

---

## How to Register a Project

To register a project, submit a pull request that adds a folder under:

- `projects/<your-project-name>/README.md`


That README must include the required transparency artifacts listed below.

No code is merged into this repository.
Only documentation that points to where real work is happening.

---

## Required Transparency Artifacts

Every registered project must include **all** of the following.

### 1. Primary Visibility Link

A single canonical link where progress is visible.

This can be:
- a code repository
- a blog
- a portfolio site
- a public document
- a static site
- a project page

The format does not matter.
It must be public and updated or explicitly marked stalled.

If the work exists but the link does not, the work is invisible.

---

### 2. Public Progress Board

A public board showing work in three states only:
- Todo
- Doing
- Done

This can be implemented however you want:
- GitHub Projects
- Issues with labels
- Markdown lists
- Plain text tables

This board exists for coordination, not personal productivity.

Items should move when reality changes.

---

### 3. Scope and Usable Outcome

Your project must clearly state:
- the problem you are trying to address
- what you are explicitly **not** trying to solve
- what a usable outcome looks like **right now**

“Learning” is an acceptable outcome if stated clearly.

---

### 4. Time Horizon (Communication Only)

Provide a rough estimate for the next meaningful outcome:
- days / weeks / months
- confidence level (high / medium / low)

This is not a promise.
This is not a commitment.
This exists only to help others coordinate and decide when to engage.

Being wrong is acceptable.
Being silent is not.

---

### 5. Testing / Contact Surface

When you mark something as “done” (even temporarily), you must say:

> How can someone else touch this?

Examples:
- run a command
- try a demo
- review a spec
- break an assumption
- attempt an integration

If it cannot be tested yet, say so and do not mark it done.

---

### 6. Help Surface

Every project must include a section describing:
- where help would be useful
- what you are unsure about
- what skills you lack
- what review would be valuable

You are encouraged to ask early and publicly.

---

### 7. Project Journal / Decision Log

Projects should maintain a public journal or decision trail that records:
- major decisions
- assumptions
- reversals
- mistakes
- reasoning

This does not need to be polished.
Dated notes are sufficient.

The goal is shared memory, not justification.

---

### 8. Status Flag

Each project must declare its current status:
- Active
- Blocked
- Paused
- Abandoned (for now)
- Superseded

Stopping is allowed.
Disappearing is not.

If a project is abandoned, briefly explain why.
That explanation is considered a successful contribution.

---

## Testing and Integration Work

Testing is real work.

Projects that reach a usable state should create explicit testing tasks.
Testers are encouraged to:
- surface failures
- challenge assumptions
- propose integration tasks
- document friction

Testing does not imply approval.
It is contact with reality.

---

## Cultural Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

- There are no protected ideas.
- There are no owners, only temporary stewards.
- There is no prestige in suffering quietly.
- There is no penalty for being wrong early.
- The only unacceptable behavior is opacity.

Visible, imperfect work is preferred over invisible perfection.

---

## If You’re Unsure

If you are unsure whether something is “ready” to register:
- register it anyway
- mark it early
- be explicit about uncertainty

Scrumerica optimizes for shared understanding, not confidence.

Start where you are.
Make it visible.
Move.
