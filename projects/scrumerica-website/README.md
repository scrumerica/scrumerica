# Scrumerica Website

## Primary Visibility Link
- Code / repo: https://github.com/spiffy2006/scrumerica
- Live site (if deployed): https://www.scrumerica.org

This repository and deployment are the canonical source of truth for the Scrumerica website.

## Status
Active

## Problem Statement

Scrumerica needs a public, inspectable surface that explains:
- what Scrumerica is
- what it is not
- how to participate
- what transparency means in practice

Without a website, Scrumerica exists only as a repository and an idea.  
That raises the barrier to understanding and participation.

The website is not a marketing tool.  
It is a **clarity tool**.

---

## Non-Goals

This project is explicitly **not** trying to:
- build a polished brand
- optimize for growth or conversion
- persuade people ideologically
- act as a social platform
- centralize authority or direction
- be permanent or final

The site should be easy to replace.

---

## Usable Outcome (Current)

A usable outcome for this project is:
- a public webpage that explains Scrumerica in plain language
- a clear path to the GitHub org and `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- enough context that a first-time visitor can decide:
  “Is this something I want to engage with?”

Visual polish is optional.
Clarity is required.

## Public Progress Board

Todo / Doing / Done:
- https://trello.com/b/WqC6WZJt/scrumerica
(Currently the main scrumerica board, but if the website grows bigger will make a separate board)

Example items:
- clarify homepage copy
- explain transparency contract simply
- link to example projects
- accessibility review
- hosting / deployment decisions

---

## Time Horizon

- Initial usable version: A weekend
- Confidence: high

This estimate is for coordination only, not commitment.

---

## Testing / Contact Surface

Ways to test this project:
- Visit the site and answer:
  - Do you understand what Scrumerica is?
  - Do you understand how to contribute?
  - Is anything confusing, misleading, or overconfident?
- Try to explain Scrumerica to someone else after reading the site.
- Attempt to register a project using only the site and repo links.

Feedback should be filed as issues or PRs in the website repo.

---

## Help Wanted

Useful help includes:
- copy critique (clarity, tone, honesty)
- accessibility review
- content structure suggestions
- hosting or stack recommendations
- identifying assumptions or missing context
- pressure-testing whether the site accidentally creates hierarchy or gatekeeping

Design help is welcome, but simplicity is preferred.

---

## Project Journal / Decision Log

Journal / notes:
- (in progress - will publish chatgpt chats where all my brainstorming is)

Topics to capture:
- why this copy was chosen
- what was removed and why
- hosting and stack tradeoffs
- feedback received and acted on
- things that felt unclear or contentious

Mistakes and reversals are valuable data.

---

## Notes

This site is intentionally minimal and replaceable, and almost entirely vibe coded. Something was better than nothing in this case.

If someone wants to build a better version, that is success.
If someone wants to fork it, that is expected.
If this version is abandoned after serving its purpose, that is acceptable.

The only failure mode is opacity.
